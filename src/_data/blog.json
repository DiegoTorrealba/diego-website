          "value": "Over the weekend, I was fortunate enough to be recognized as a College Scholar at UT Austin’s 77th Annual Honors Day for my work as an undergraduate student. Of the many pieces of advice given at the ceremony, I resonated most with guest speaker Dr. Peter Stone’s urge for us to be lifelong learners, capable of learning new tricks and frameworks throughout our careers."

          "value": "Stone mentioned that, as the world and the job market evolve, many of us, including myself, will likely pursue different careers rather than sticking to one for most of our professional lives. This means being a student does not end once you receive your diploma. If anything, your diploma marks only the end of your formal instruction, but you’ll continue to learn from your jobs, your experiences, and (most importantly) your mistakes."

          "value": "While it may seem obvious, being open to learning new things is crucial for effective lifelong learning. Too often, pride in our skills or abilities can make us complacent about identifying areas for improvement. But in this age, we must strive to refine ourselves continually, especially as technology continues to evolve. What worked today may not always work tomorrow, and, as a young person, I need to keep this in mind as I make assumptions about how the future will look."

          "value": "To this end, I pledge always to learn more than what I “need” to know while accepting that what I do know can be flawed or incomplete. I will never assert that I know everything I can learn about any topic, and I will always be open to reframing my paradigm as new information or arguments arise. This way, my mind will stay sharp, and my skills will be adaptable as the world evolves quickly."

          "value": "When considering different story ideas worth pursuing, a journalist often envisions a unique story that would be very impactful to the beat they cover but is intimidated by the work required to produce such a story correctly. This, coupled with the haste to keep up with the 24-hour news cycle, leads to these innovative ideas getting swept under the rug for stories that are easier and cheaper to produce."

          "type": "text",
          "value": "However, there are ways to make these innovative story ideas feel less daunting. A journalist usually might not pursue an idea because of the statistical or technical skills required to produce the story. With enough practice, though, these data-driven stories can become as “doable” as those that do not require coding experience or technical knowledge."

          "value": "To offer my experience as an example, I initially cringed at the sight of large Excel spreadsheets and CSVs before I renewed my effort to learn about programming languages and data analytics. The word “statistics” alone alarmed me, and I thought I could never navigate the tremendous number of resources available. However, after receiving formal instruction in various programming languages, learning about data manipulation techniques and dedicating time to practice with online resources, I now feel much more confident handling data and presenting it in visually engaging ways."

          "type": "text",
          "value": "This is to say that even if an idea might seem impossible initially, don’t let it discourage you from pursuing it. Instead, make it your goal to learn how to produce it! Whether it be programming, three-dimensional modeling, or any other technical skill, you might not have the skills to do it now, but with enough practice and effort, it can fall within the realm of possibility. Often, you’ll find it exciting just how much you can learn quickly when you put your mind to it."
